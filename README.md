ASP.NET-MVC-Plugins
===================

I have been working on this for better part of a year during my free time at work. I finally have a working example of how to do fully on DLL plugins for ASP.NET MVC. It is the gathering of many partial solutions and blog posts to make a functional example. 

With that said. There are some open issues. 
-The virtual file lookup needs to be WAY better.
-Needs a way to add routes from the plugins.
